A project I made for the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons game for the Switch. Built using React Native and published to the iOS App Store.

My first attempt working with React Native specifically and Expo. Still a work in progress - looking to make the components more reusable now that it's been released.

You can view and download the app at the App Store for free here:
